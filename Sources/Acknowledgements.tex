Firstly, I am deeply grateful to my supervisors -- Prof Alan Mycroft and Dr Dominic Orchard -- for their excellent guidance, constructive advice, and abundant patience.

I'd like to acknowledge the role of many people with whom I discussed ideas that culminated in this thesis -- particularly Stephen Dolan, Neel Krishnaswami, Alistair O'Brien, Euan Ong, Jesse Tov, and Leo White -- and anyone else who had the patience to listen to my explanations and offered their thoughts.

I am thankful to my parents for always supporting me, and all my friends for making my last year as an undergraduate at Cambridge so memorable.
